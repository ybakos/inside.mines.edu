<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>This is a proposal for an excellent introduction to computer science course. It is split into two semesters (or three quarters) serving both the computer science major and students from all disciplines who need to learn how to program. The course covers history and culture, first principles, programming basics with Ruby, practical skills with VB.NET, and computing and programming details with C and Scheme. It thoroughly prepares students for further computer science education or at the very least, a working knowledge of how to program.</p>
<p>... It is an awesome course. You know you want it. ... </p>

<h3>The Best Introduction to Computer Science?</h3>
<p>The first semester teaches the history and culture of computer science, fundamental principles and how to program. This semester is intended for students of all disciplines. As such, in addition to programming with Ruby, students are taught how to program Office applications such as Excel with VB.NET. At the end of the first semester, the student will have a sense of the postmodern context of computer science and its people, projects and challenges; a practical knowledge of scripting with Ruby; and how to automate and interact with Office applications for practical interdisciplinary productivity.</p>
<p>The second semester, which focuses on C and Scheme, is intended for the computer science undergraduate. It immediately engages students with programming best practices, educates students on the best postmodern tools, and focuses on the details of how computing and programs work through the hands-on exploration of C and Scheme. At the end of the second semester, the student will be able to create and use a postmodern development environment, collaborate effectively with other programmers, understand how programs work, and will have contributed to an open source project.</p>

<!-- <p>Teaches history, culture, context, purpose, vision, potential. Teaches core principles, fun programming basics with Ruby, practical development with C, and  -->

<h3>Course Plan</h3>

<h3>Execution &amp; Curriculum Integration</h3>
<p>This class is ready to immediately become a part of any university computer science or engineering curriculum. Semester one is for students of all disciplines and semester two is for the computer science undergraduate. An optional semester two for non-CS majors could be a course specific to VBA.net and Excel programming. Please direct any questions about this proposal to me by calling (303) 653-3017.</p>
